  	<h2 class="chicken">Chicken</h2>
  	<p>Among the most famous Indian foods, tandoori chicken is loved by people the world over. The nicest thing about this dish is that it's really easy to make. It gets its name from the way it is cooked—in a tandoor, or clay oven. After the chicken is marinated in a spiced yogurt mixture, the pieces are threaded onto skewers, and then placed in the tandoor to cook.</p>
